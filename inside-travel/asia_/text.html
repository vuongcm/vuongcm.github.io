                            Friendliness appears in every corner of the streets in Vietnam, not only in rural sites but in modern cities as well. People will notice your family, people will <b>smile</b>, wave with your daughters and sons, and try to help you as much as possible. Vietnamese young generation are very eager for learning new culture and making friends, then don’t surprise when seeing them just running out of their houses simply to wave “<b>Hello</b>! <b>Hello</b>!” and get some smiles.
